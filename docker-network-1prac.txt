docker network 
-----------------
Docker has three network mode
 1)None
 ----
 This mode will not configure any IP for the container and doesn’t have any access to the external network as well as for other containers.
 It does have the loopback address and can be used for running batch jobs.
 docker run -it --network=none ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash
  ifconfig
  
  docker inspect 5001854304b8 | grep -i ipaddr
  
  2)Host
  ------
  In this mode container will share the host’s network stack and all interfaces from the host will be available to the container.
  The container’s host name will match the host name on the host system
  
  docker run -it --net=host ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash
  hostname
  ip addr | grep -A 2 eth0 ( to check ip address of the host machine)
  ip addr | grep -A 2 docker0 ( to check docker ip address)
  
  
  In host and none mode are not configured directly but default bridge network can be configured as well as create your own user-defined bridge networks.
  
  3) Bridge mode
  ---------------
  It is the Docker default networking mode which will enable the connectivity to the other interfaces of the host machine as well as among containers.
  docker run -it --network=bridge ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash  ( container run with bridge network mode)
  ifconfig 
  ip a | grep eth0
  
  Bridge network: Bridge is the default network in docker which is also called as docker0. 
  It is the default network that bridges through the NAT firewall to the physical that your host is connected to. 
  But, we don't care about it as all the containers will attach to this network and worked.
  
  Host Network: is a special network which skips the virtual networking of docker and attach the container directly to host interface. 
  It's really not recommended but, in certain situations, can improve the performance of high throughput networking and in other,
  you will loose out of few benefits of containerization.
  
  None Network: is kind of equivalent to having an interface on your machine that's not attched to anything, 
  but we can create our own. The none network adds a container to a container-specific network stack. That container lacks a network interface.
  
  docker network inspect host ( to check all details about host network mode)
  docker network inspect bridge ( to check all details about bridge network mode)
  docker network inspect none   ( to check all details about none network mode)
