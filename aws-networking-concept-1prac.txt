Networking with AWS concept:
------------------------------
IP Address is short for Internet Protocol Address.
It is a unique address assigned to each computing device in an IP network.
ISP assigns IP Address to all the devices present on its network.
Computing devices use IP Address to identify and communicate with other devices in the IP network.


There are two systems in which IP Addresses are classified-
     classful IP address   & classless system ip address / CIDR ( classless Interdomain Routing)
Classful Ip address
-------------------
In Classful Addressing System, IP Addresses are organized into following 5 classes-
Class A 
-----
In class A IP Address,
The first 8 bits are used for the Network ID.
The remaining 24 bits are used for the Host ID.

Class B
Class C
Class D
Class E

Class of IP Address	Total Number of IP Addresses 	1st Octet Decimal Range	Number of Networks available	Hosts per network	Default Subnet Mask
Class A	231	1 – 126	27 – 2	224 – 2	255.0.0.0    >  0.0.0.0  to 126.255.255.255      > NASA 

Class B	230	128 – 191	214	216 – 2	255.255.0.0  >  128.0.0.0  t0 191.255.255.255    > general purpose
Class C	229	192 – 223	221	28 – 2	255.255.255.0 >  192.0.0.0  to 224.255.255.255   > general purpose
Class D	228	224 – 239	Not defined	Not defined	Not defined > 225.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255   > broad casting purpose 
Class E	228	240 – 254	Not defined	Not defined	Not defined > 240.0.0.0  to 255.255.255.255  > rearch purpose 

 

Classless Addressing is an improved IP Addressing system.
It makes the allocation of IP Addresses more efficient.
It replaces the older classful addressing system based on classes.
It is also known as Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR).
 

Classless Addressing-(CIDR)

Classless Addressing is an improved IP Addressing system.
It makes the allocation of IP Addresses more efficient.
It replaces the older classful addressing system based on classes.
It is also known as Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR).
 
 172.31.0.0/16  how to calculate total ip on CIDR :
  2^32-n   = 2^32-16 = 2^16 = 65536
  
 How many VPC's we can created one region >>> 5 (softlimit adjustable)
 How many VPC subnet we can make >> 200  ( softlimit adjustable)
 
In subnet first 4 ip and last ip is reserved for AWS.
